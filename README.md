### How to install this project

1. Clone this repo
2. Run npm install

### How it works

1. After running the command node index.js in the command line, the use is welcomed into the game.

2. The game function is called, which calls other functions. One funciton selects a word from the list of words. Another functions hides the word by changing it to a series of underscores.

3. The user is prompted to guess on of the letters. If the user guesses correctly, that letter is revealed in place of the corresponding underscore. If the user guesses incorrectly, a try is deducted from their bank of ten tries.

4. These steps are repeated as necessary until either the user guesses the correct word or they run out of tries.
